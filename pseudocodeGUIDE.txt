Main Constructs of Pseudocode

SEQUENCE
WHILE
REPEAT UNTIL
FOR
IF THEN ELSE
CASE

COMMANDS
Calling function (CALL)
Handling exceptions (EXCEPTION, WHEN)

HOW TO WRITE
1. Always capitalize initial word (constructs)
2. one statement per line
3. indent to show hierarchy
4. end multiline with END keywords (ENDIF, ENDWHILE)
5. keep statement programming language independent (?)
6. Use naming domain, not the implementation
7. keep it simple

Say an employer is designing a 10-question, multiple-choice quiz for employees to take after reading content on workplace safety. Those who get at least eight questions correct pass the quiz and receive a certificate of completion. Those who don’t reach this benchmark must retake the quiz. The pseudocode for an algorithm determining those who pass and fail could look like this:

	IF employee gets eight or more questions correct 
   	Display message: “Congratulations on passing the quiz!” 
      Transition to printable certificate of completion page   
   ELSE
   	Display message: “Let’s try again!” 
   	Transition back to first page of quiz
